# Industrial Cluster Discovery via NLP

## Overview

This repository contains the resources and findings from my master's thesis titled "Industrial Cluster Discovery via NLP." The project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and cluster business activities in Milton Keynes. The goal is to use textual data from company websites to perform geo-spatial analysis and identify clusters of business activities.

## Thesis Abstract

This master's thesis explores the discovery of industrial clusters in the city of Milton Keynes by analyzing textual data from company websites. By employing NLP and ML techniques, semantic information is extracted from the text and used to perform clustering that reveals patterns and trends within the business landscape. The approach includes the collection, preprocessing, and analysis of web data to map business activities and provide insights into the city's economic landscape.

## Key Components

- **Data Collection**: Gathering textual data from company websites using APIs and web scraping tools.
- **Geo-spatial Analysis**: Creating density maps and identifying clusters of business activities using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
- **NLP and ML Models**: Applying topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and transformer-based clustering using BERTopic.
- **Visualization**: Mapping and visualizing business clusters, highlighting different sectors and their distribution across the city.

## Results

The results include a detailed analysis of industrial clusters in Milton Keynes and visualizations of the distribution of various business sectors. These findings provide valuable insights into the economic landscape of the city and can guide urban planning and development strategies.
